# Microbial-Co-occurrence-Analysis (MiCA)

This repository contains a vignette of how to apply the Microbial-Co-occurrence-Analysis (MiCA) analysis to discover gut microbial cliques associated with any health outcome. MiCA is conducted in two stages to identify microbial cliques associated with chemical exposures. The first part of this algorithm uses a machine learning-based prediction framework to discover microbial cliques predictive of the health outcome. The next stage restores the directionality and dives into estimating the association between the joint-relative abundance of the discovered cliques and the health outcome using a causal inference (or simply classical association-based) framework.
